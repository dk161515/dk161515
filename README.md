## üí° Development Philosophy

> *"Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares."* - Robert C. Martin

I believe in writing **maintainable**, **testable**, and **scalable** code. Every line should serve a purpose, every function should do one thing well, and every application should provide an exceptional user experience.
